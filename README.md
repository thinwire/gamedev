## A simple HTML5 game developed in TypeScript

### Preparation: get tools

- Make sure you have GNU Make installed
- Install Node.js
- Open a terminal
- type `npm -g install typescript`
- once finished, type `tsc --version`. You should have at least version 2.0.6.
- (Optional): install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

### To compile

- Open up a terminal
- In the project folder, type `make`

### Developing

- Open up a terminal
- In the project folder, type `make dev`

### Gameplay

Phase 1: Created a simple sprite controllable with the keyboard. The sprite cannot
move away from the screen.

Phase 2: PacMan now shoots lasers and has better movement behavior. Press space to shoot!
