# GameDev Demonstration
## A simple HTML5 game developed in TypeScript

### Preparation: get tools

- Install Node.js
- Open a terminal
- type `npm -g install typescript`
- once finished, type `tsc --version`. You should have at least version 2.0.6.

### To compile

- Open up a terminal
- In the project folder, type `tsc *.ts --removeComments --sourceMap --watch`
- If you add source files, you'll need to stop and restart the TypeScript Compiler.

### Gameplay

Phase 1: Created a simple sprite controllable with the keyboard. The sprite cannot
move away from the screen.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Petter Holmstr√∂m for his interest in this project :)
